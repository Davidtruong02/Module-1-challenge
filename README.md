# Module-1-challenge

## Description

This project was made to test our current knowledge of HTML, and CSS. What we're challeged with was to increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page, making it more accessibly to other developers and clients.
